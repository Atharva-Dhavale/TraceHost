# TraceHost: Advanced Domain Analysis & Security Assessment Platform

## Overview

TraceHost is a comprehensive web application designed for analyzing domains and assessing their security posture. The platform provides detailed information about domains, identifies potential security risks, and offers AI-powered analysis to help users make informed decisions about domain trustworthiness.

## Core Features

### Domain Analysis
- Complete WHOIS information retrieval
- DNS record analysis
- Historical DNS tracking
- Subdomain enumeration
- IP and geolocation tracking
- ASN (Autonomous System Number) information
- SSL certificate analysis

### Security Assessment
- AI-powered risk scoring (0-100)
- Traditional heuristic-based risk assessment
- Detailed security analysis reports
- Risk factor identification
- Suspicious domain tracking

### Monitoring & Management
- Dashboard with domain statistics and trends
- Flagging capabilities for suspicious domains
- Historical analysis data preservation
- Geographic distribution visualization

### Developer Tools
- Comprehensive REST API
- API authentication
- Code examples in multiple languages
- API status monitoring

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Django)
The backend is built with Django (Python) and provides the core functionality for domain analysis. It leverages several third-party services and libraries:

- **WHOIS Lookup**: Retrieves domain registration information
- **DNS Resolution**: Analyzes domain name system records
- **SecurityTrails Integration**: Used for historical DNS and subdomain enumeration
- **IPinfo API**: Provides geolocation and ASN data
- **Shodan API**: Gathers additional security information
- **Google Gemini AI**: Powers the AI-based risk assessment


The backend implements sophisticated retry logic, caching mechanisms, and fallback strategies to ensure reliability.

### Frontend (Next.js)
The frontend is built with Next.js and offers a responsive, user-friendly interface with:

- Modern UI components using Shadcn/UI
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Interactive data visualization
- Real-time API status indicators
- PDF and CSV export capabilities

## Risk Assessment System

TraceHost employs a dual-track approach to risk assessment:

### Traditional Risk Scoring
- Domain age analysis (newer domains are higher risk)
- Registration information completeness check
- Geographical risk assessment
- TLD trustworthiness evaluation

### AI-Powered Risk Analysis
- Uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze multiple domain factors
- Examines domain name patterns for phishing indicators
- Assesses registration patterns against known malicious behaviors
- Evaluates hosting location risk factors
- Generates comprehensive security summaries
- Provides specific user recommendations

The system uses a 0-100 risk score where higher scores indicate higher risk. Domains with trusted TLDs (.edu, .gov, .ac, .sch, .mil) automatically receive lower risk scores.

## API Functionality

The platform offers a comprehensive API for integration with other systems:

### Endpoints
- `/analyze`: Provides complete domain analysis
- `/suspicious`: Returns suspicious domain analysis
- `/flag_domain`: Flags/unflags domains for investigation
- `/dashboard`: Retrieves statistical dashboard data
- `/suspicious_domains`: Lists suspicious domains with filtering

### Authentication
- Token-based authentication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Response Formats
- JSON formatted responses
- Streaming capabilities for long-running analyses
- Comprehensive error handling

## Dashboard & Analytics

The platform includes advanced analytics capabilities:

- Risk score distribution visualization
- Geographical distribution of analyzed domains
- Time-based analysis trends
- Top suspicious domains tracking
- Suspicious vs. safe domain ratios

## Security Features

TraceHost includes several security-focused features:

- Trusted TLD recognition (.edu, .gov, etc.)
- Caching for previously analyzed suspicious domains
- Domain age verification
- WHOIS privacy analysis
- Geographical risk assessment
- AI-driven pattern recognition for phishing domains
- SSL certificate validation

## Use Cases

- **Security Teams**: Evaluate domain trustworthiness before allowing network access
- **Threat Intelligence**: Identify and track potentially malicious domains
- **Email Security**: Validate domains in incoming emails to prevent phishing
- **Brand Protection**: Monitor for domain squatting and brand impersonation
- **Development**: Validate domain integrity in code dependencies
- **Education**: Learn about domain security indicators and risk factors

## Performance Optimizations

- API response caching
- Streaming responses for long-running analyses
- Automatic retry logic for external API calls
- Dashboard data caching
- Progressive loading of analysis results

## Data Storage

Domains flagged for investigation are stored in a database with:
- Complete analysis results
- Risk scores
- Geographic information
- Registration details
- Timestamps for scans and flagging

## Roadmap Features

The codebase suggests several potential upcoming features:
- Enhanced AI analysis capabilities
- Additional data sources integration
- Improved visualization tools
- Real-time monitoring of domain changes
- Batch analysis capabilities
- Custom alerting for suspicious domain activity
